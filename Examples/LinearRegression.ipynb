    "$i = 1,2,\\ldots,N$, to a straight line, $y=ax+b$.  The process of determining the best-fit line is called <i>linear regression</i>.  This involves choosing the parameters $a$ and $b$ to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between the data points and the linear function.  How the differences are defined varies.  If there are only uncertainties in the <i>y</i> direction, then the differences in the vertical direction (the gray lines in the figure below) are used.  If there are uncertainties in both the $x$ and $y$ directions, the orthogonal (perpendicular) distances from the line (the dotted red lines in the figure below) are used."
